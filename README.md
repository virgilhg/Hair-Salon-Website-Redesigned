# Hair Salon Website Redesigned

This repository contains a simple example website for a hair salon or barber shop. The goal is to demonstrate how to build a clean and modern site using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Structure

```
website/
  index.html    # Main page
  style.css     # Stylesheet for the site
  script.js     # JavaScript for interactive behavior
```

## Usage

Open `website/index.html` in your browser to view the site. The code is kept intentionally simple so it can be easily customized and handed off to others.
